# Filter Faulty sgRNA

### Description
We designed multiple sgRNA for each target site to account for off-target/non-functional sgRNA. This approach compares the distribution of all sgRNA for a given target across
the CM subpopulations from our large screen. sgRNA that have a bias in distribution in comparison to the rest for the same target are excluded from downstream analaysis.
