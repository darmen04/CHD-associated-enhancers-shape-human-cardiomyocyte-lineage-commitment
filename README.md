# Repression of CHD-associated enhancers delays human cardiomyocyte lineage commitment

### Highlights
* Single-cell enhancer perturbation screens during human cardiomyocyte differentiation.
* Perturbation of CHD-associated enhancers and target genes delays CM maturation.
* TBX5 enhancers delay transition from mid to late CM cell states.
* TBX5 enhancer knockouts exhibit CHD-relevant cellular phenotypes.
